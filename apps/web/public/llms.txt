## General Questions

Q: What is Suptia?
A: Suptia is a meta-search engine for supplements that compares products across
   multiple e-commerce sites using scientific evidence. It provides transparent
   ratings based on 5 pillars: price, content, cost-effectiveness, evidence,
   and safety.

Q: How does Suptia evaluate supplements?
A: We use a 5-pillar system: (1) Price comparison across EC sites, (2) Ingredient
   content analysis, (3) Cost-effectiveness calculation (¥/mg), (4) Evidence
   level based on peer-reviewed studies (S/A/B/C/D), and (5) Safety scoring
   including additive analysis and interaction warnings.

Q: What is the evidence level rating?
A: S = Large RCTs/meta-analyses, A = Quality studies confirm effectiveness,
   B = Limited studies with conditional effectiveness, C = Animal/small-scale
   studies, D = Theoretical/unverified. Each ingredient page shows the specific
   studies supporting its rating.

Q: Is Suptia free to use?
A: Yes, all features are free. We use affiliate links to EC sites for revenue,
   but this does not influence our scientific evaluations.

## Scientific Questions

Q: What sources does Suptia use for evidence ratings?
A: Primary sources include PubMed (NCBI), Cochrane Library, 厚生労働省 (Japanese
   Ministry of Health), NIH Office of Dietary Supplements, and EFSA.

Q: How often is information updated?
A: Product prices update daily at 3:00 AM JST. Scientific evidence is reviewed
   annually or when major new studies are published.

Q: What is the safety score?
A: A 0-100 score based on: ingredient interaction risks, side effect profiles,
   additive safety (artificial sweeteners, preservatives), and regulatory
   warnings. Scores below 70 indicate caution is needed.

================================================================================
                     TIER RANKING SYSTEM
================================================================================

## Overall Tier Ranks (S+ to D)
S+ - Five Crown: All 5 pillars rated S (extremely rare)
S  - Excellent: Large-scale RCTs, meta-analyses, best-in-class
A  - Very Good: Quality studies confirming effectiveness
B  - Good: Limited studies, conditional effectiveness
C  - Fair: Animal studies, small-scale trials
D  - Preliminary: Theoretical, unverified

## Ranking Logic
- Disqualification: Safety or Evidence rank D → Overall rank D
- Five Crown (S+): All 5 axes (Price, Cost-Effectiveness, Content, Evidence, Safety) = S
- Otherwise: Weighted average calculation

## Safety Score Adjustments
- Additive deduction: -5 to -10 points for problematic additives
  (Sucralose: -5, Aspartame: -5, Acesulfame K: -3)
- Warning count penalty: -10 points if 3+ warnings
- Final score capped at 0-100
