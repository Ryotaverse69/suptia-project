### 2. About Your Business（ビジネスについて）

**Business Description（150-300 words）:**

```
Suptia is a next-generation supplement decision engine that empowers consumers to make informed, evidence-based choices in the supplement market. Our platform combines three critical elements: Safety, Cost-Effectiveness, and Scientific Evidence.

Unlike traditional e-commerce sites, Suptia operates as a meta-search and comparison platform, providing users with comprehensive, unbiased information to help them select the best supplements for their needs. We aggregate data from multiple retailers, including iHerb, Amazon, and Rakuten, offering real-time price comparisons normalized by ingredient content.

Our unique value proposition includes:

1. Scientific Evidence Evaluation - Each supplement is rated based on peer-reviewed research from sources like PubMed and Cochrane Reviews
2. Safety Compliance - Automated screening for drug interactions, contraindications, and regulatory compliance
3. Cost Analysis - Normalized pricing (cost per mg) to help users identify true value
4. Personalized Recommendations - AI-driven suggestions based on health goals and safety profiles

Our target audience consists of health-conscious consumers aged 25-55 who value transparency, scientific backing, and cost-effectiveness. We serve both beginners seeking guidance and experienced supplement users looking for the best deals.

As a content-rich platform with detailed ingredient guides and educational resources, we drive high-intent traffic to partner retailers, resulting in strong conversion rates.
